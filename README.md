This code provides a CLIPS application for the evaluation of agents in the classic Wumpus World. Students are expected to design agents, with the CLIPS programming language, that wander smartly in the Wumpus World. The application allows students to execute their programs step-by-step, continuosly or until halt. It also shows students the facts base and the agenda.

In case you would like to compile this software, please, fork the repository, and:
1. Download CLIPS JNI: https://clipsrules.net/CLIPSJNI.html (I am sorry, at this momment I can not recall the version)
2. After uncompressing the file, you should have, at least, the following directories in your working directory: java-src and library-src
3. Copy the files in this repository in the same working directory
4. Compile with make and the corresponding makefile

All the best!
